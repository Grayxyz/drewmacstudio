            <p>SIn 2016 the Savannah College of Art and Design Museum of Modern Art, commissioned this seal commemorating William and Ellen Craft's escape from slavery.  The building that houses SCAD MOA used to function as the Savannah train station, and it was through that very train station that the Crafts staged their daring escape. Leveraging the
                arbitrariness of the slavery system, William posed as Ellen's slave and, given her light complexion, the two were able to hide in plain sight on their journey north.</p>

               <p> SCAD produced a documentary about the couple's escape from slavery. You can find the documentary the <a href="https://www.scadmoa.org/about/william-and-ellen-craft" target="_blank">feature article on the SCAD Museum of Art webiste</a></p>

            <p>I originally conceived of the design as combination of a compass and the north star, but shifted the focus to the train, shrinking the the north star compass motif to a background element. In order to push the symbolism of distance I built the train and landscape in Cinema 4D, modeled around a sphere and rendered with a wide field of view. In order to produce a vector file that could be used to engrave the design in bronze, I rendered the original 3D system with cel shaders and converted the shapes to 2D vectors to mill the design into solid brass </p>
